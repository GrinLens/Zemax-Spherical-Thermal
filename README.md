# Zemax-Spherical-Thermal
First order thermal modeling of spherical GRIN

NOTE (4/3/2019): Sincere apologies to early adopters.  It was discovered just today that 
the original upload (7/17/2018) was inadvertently corrupted by an intermediate version of
the code.  The thermal variation of geometric parameters was modeled, but thermal variation
of material refractive indices had yet to be implemented. The current documents and DLL
represent what was *intended* to be uploaded.  Again, apologies for the confusion.

Bare-bones release July 17, 2018.  This represents an extension of the spherical GRIN model
available at https://github.com/GrinLens/Zemax-Spherical-GRIN/releases.  It is highly
recommended that one read the documentation available there before attempting to use this tool.
Example files may follow.

It should be acknowledged that the thermal treatment of any lens in Zemax is awkward
and prone to error.  This is doubly so when handling GRIN lenses.  It is recommended that,
at the very least, an initial user of this tool model a GRIN-based singlet with a homogeneous
composition and compare it to an identical, all-Zemax homogeneous singlet.  Ensure that ray
traces and lens specifications of the two lenses agree, in detail, at multiple temperatures
before embarking on GRIN design.

NOTE: This first-order model should be treated as a guide to order-of-magnitude thermal trends,
only. The authors can make no claim to rigorous accuracy for fielded applications, which requires
detailed, material-specific information not provided in this general package.
